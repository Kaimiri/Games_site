Welcome to the treasure hunt! There are five bags of puzzle pieces hidden around that together make one puzzle. Each clue will lead you to the next bag. Be the first team to complete the puzzle to win.


You may want a few team members as dedicated puzzle-solvers. Perhaps if you have team members who don't want to solve problems and run around finding puzzle pieces - (or who just want mince pies with a lovely puzzle).
